            <aside>Today, the safety of women in India is widely discussed everywhere. Now it has <br>
                become a serious problem. The crime rate is skyrocketing. Women are not safe either <br>
                at home or outside. Female travelers from other countries also find themselves in a<br>
                 precarious position when traveling to India. But these fears cannot stop them from <br>
                 any social activity. There are laws, but there must be adequate security measures that <br>
                 must be strictly followed to protect against violence against women.<br>
                 Violence and discrimination threaten women's lives and prevent them from participating<br>
                 in any social activities. In India, she is revered by those who consider her goddess<br>
                  of the surge in crimes against women through Durga, Sati and Sabitri. Previously,<br>
                  women were confined to their homes, but urbanization has forced women to break this<br>
                   prison and show the world their talents on an equal footing with men.

            <p>Women showed off their talents in everything from taxi drivers to CEOs of multinational corporations. 
                A woman should let go of the idea that she can't do anything when she leaves the house. 
                They must admit that she also stepped on the moon. Kalpana Chawala, the first Indian woman to land on the moon,
                 has become a role model not only for women around the world, but also for all men who dream of becoming astronauts. 
                 She has become an inspiration all over the world.
                Domestic violence, sexual assault and murder are common forms of violence against women in India. 
                Dowry death is an extreme form of murder. Indians still have the psychology that a dowry is a tradition and 
                the girl's father loses everything to pay for it. Domestic violence, or domestic violence, is committed by one 
                partner with another in a relationship. Domestic violence is on the rise in India. 
                70% of women are victims of domestic violence. This leads to depression and suicide.
                It is not a direct murder, but the cause of the murder is certain. Moreover, girls are forced to marry at a young age.
                 This young bride is not yet old enough to understand her responsibilities. 
                 Acid injection is a form of brutal attack that ruins the life of a beautiful girl. 
                 "Relationship cheating" is another common crime against women. 
                 A man easily breaks up with his wife and starts a new life with another bride..</p>
